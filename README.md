## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I reinforced my learning of CSS Flexbox and also realized one of my major issues with horizontal scrollbars.
I usually used the code below and it gave me unwanted horizontal scrollbars
```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```
Right until I realized my mistake and changed it into this instead
```css
html, body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```
I also learned that i could use both an image and colour for a background at the same time
Finally I learned how to download and convert fonts to web fonts and to use it for my code.

### Continued development

I want to work on rembering important code, using CSS Grid efficiently, building more JS inclusive projects and working more with a mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources
